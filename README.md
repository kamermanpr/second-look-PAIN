second-look-PAIN
======================

This repository contains a selection of secondary analyses and redrawing of figures from research papers in the **field of pain**. The respository is under active development, and I encouraged users to fork the respository, make additions/changes, and issue pull requests. 

The folders are named according to the first author and publication date of the article from which data were extracted.
